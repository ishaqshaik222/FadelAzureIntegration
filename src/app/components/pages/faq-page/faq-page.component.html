                            <p>Simplilearn uses third party software for analytics. All metrics information collected
                                from your usage of the Service(s) shall be transmitted to our analytics provider. This
                                information is then used to evaluate how users use our platform, and to compile
                                statistical reports on user activity for us. We further use the same statistical
                                analytics tool to track or to collect your Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We
                                will use this information in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of
                                the Service(s) and to personalize the experience for you. Aggregated information and
                                analysis may be made public where desired by Simplilearn.</p>
                            <p>We and our third party advertising partners use technologies such as web beacons in
                                analyzing trends, administering the website, tracking users’ movements around the site,
                                and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive
                                reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and
                                aggregated basis.</p>

                            <h2>Do Not Track.</h2>
                            <p>Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a
                                “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which
                                sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference
                                setting. Simplilearn does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals
                                with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard
                                for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators,
                                including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Simplilearn takes privacy
                                and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor
                                developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>

                            <p>In case Simplilearn reschedules the training event, the options available to the
                                delegates are:</p>
                            <ul class="disc_methods">
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>100% refund, if the rescheduled dates do not fit
                                    into the delegate's schedule.</li>
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>The delegate would have the privilege of
                                    rescheduling and attending a class in future at his/her convenience, at any
                                    location, on any date of a scheduled training.</li>
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>The delegates, if they so wish, can send a
                                    replacement. However, this should be intimated to Simplilearn Solutions at least 3
                                    days prior to the event.</li>

                            <p>Whereas, if for some unforeseen reasons, a delegate wishes to reschedule his/her
                                registration to a future date, a rescheduling fee is charged as mentioned below:</p>
                            <ul class="disc_methods">
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>If the rescheduling request is received 10 business
                                    days prior (or more), 10% of registration fee will be charged.</li>
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>Please note that rescheduling will be subject to
                                    availability of seats.</li>
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>If the request of rescheduling is received within
                                    10 business days or less, no rescheduling will be allowed. However, the delegate can
                                    send a replacement instead.</li>
                                <li><span class="flyout_disc"></span>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the course must be
                                    attended within 6 months of the participant's original sign-up date, and no refunds
                                    or credits will be available for participants who fail to attend a course within
                                    this six-month period.</li>
